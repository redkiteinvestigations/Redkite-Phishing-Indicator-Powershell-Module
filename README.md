Welcome to RedKite Phishing Indicators Checker


RedKite is a PowerShell-based tool designed to assist security analysts and administrators in detecting suspicious mailbox configurations that might indicate email phishing attacks in Exchange Online environments. It checks for suspicious inbox rules, external redirects, and recent mailbox changes that could indicate a compromised account.

Features
üîçSuspicious Inbox Rules: Detects inbox rules that:

Delete or mark messages as read

Move messages to folders silently

Forward emails externally

External Forwards: Identifies rules that forward mail outside of accepted domains.

Recent Mailbox Changes: Highlights recent changes to mailbox configurations (optional step).

Logging: Saves logs in timestamped log files in the specified directory.

CSV Export: Allows easy export of results for reporting and analysis.
